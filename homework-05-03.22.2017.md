## Due Date

Wednesday, March 29, 2017

## Part A

- Setup project

  ```
  $ cd /path/to/rails/project
  $ bundle install
  ```

- Test your basic understanding of debugging a Rails application through the
  following:

  - verify that the following works as expected

    - creating post

    - editing post

    - deleting post

    - listing post

    Note:  You can execute the units tests to verify that things are working
           correctly by running the unit tests as follows in the root directory
           of the project:

           ```
           $ rails test
           ```

           You are done when the above command generates the similar output:

           ```
           Running via Spring preloader in process 27856
           Run options: --seed 21319

           # Running:

           .......

           Finished in 1.234650s, 5.6696 runs/s, 7.2895 assertions/s.

           7 runs, 9 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
           ```
